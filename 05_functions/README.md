# Python Functions (Section 05)

This section explores function definition, arguments, and advanced function concepts.

## List and Description of the Codes
- **basic_function.py**: Demonstrates the syntax for defining a basic function.
- **function_arguments.py**: Illustrates the use of positional, keyword, and default arguments.
- **return_values.py**: Shows how to return values from functions.
- **lambda_functions.py**: Provides examples of lambda functions and their usage.
- **higher_order_functions.py**: Explains higher-order functions with examples.
- **decorators.py**: Demonstrates the use of decorators in modifying function behavior.

## Exercise Descriptions

### Exercise 1: Basic Function Definition
This exercise covers the syntax for defining a basic function in Python, including the use of the `def` keyword and function parameters.

### Exercise 2: Function Arguments
In this exercise, you will learn about different types of function arguments, including positional, keyword, and default arguments.

### Exercise 3: Return Values
This exercise focuses on how to return values from functions and the importance of the `return` statement.

### Exercise 4: Lambda Functions
Here, you will explore lambda functions, their syntax, and how they can be used for short, anonymous function definitions.

### Exercise 5: Higher-Order Functions
This exercise introduces higher-order functions, which can take other functions as arguments or return them as results.

### Exercise 6: Decorators
In this exercise, you will learn about decorators in Python, how they modify the behavior of functions, and their practical applications.
