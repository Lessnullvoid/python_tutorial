# File Handling in Python (Section 07)

This section covers file operations, including text, CSV, JSON, and exception handling.

## Directory Structure 

## List of Codes
- **text_file_handling.py**: Demonstrates basic operations with text files, including reading, writing, and appending.
- **csv_file_handling.py**: Shows how to read from and write to CSV files using the `csv` module.
- **json_file_handling.py**: Illustrates how to work with JSON data, including serialization and deserialization.
- **exception_handling.py**: Provides examples of handling exceptions that may occur during file operations.

## Content of This Section
In this section, you will learn how to:
- Open and close files in Python.

- Handle CSV and JSON file formats.
- Implement exception handling to manage errors during file operations.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this section, you should be able to:
1. Understand the different modes of file operations in Python.
2. Perform read and write operations on text, CSV, and JSON files.
3. Implement error handling to ensure robust file operations.

## How to Run the Programs
To run the programs in this section, follow these steps:
1. Ensure you have Python installed on your machine.
2. Navigate to the `07_file_handling` directory in your terminal.
3. Run the desired script using the command:
