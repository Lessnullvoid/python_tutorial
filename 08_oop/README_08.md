# Object-Oriented Programming in Python (Section 08)

This section covers object-oriented programming concepts and implementation.

## Directory Structure 

## List of Codes
- **class_example.py**: Demonstrates the creation and usage of classes in Python.
- **inheritance_example.py**: Shows how inheritance works in Python, including method overriding.
- **polymorphism_example.py**: Illustrates polymorphism through method overloading and overriding.
- **encapsulation_example.py**: Explains encapsulation and how to use private and public attributes.

## Content of This Section
In this section, we will explore the fundamental concepts of object-oriented programming (OOP) in Python, including:
- Classes and Objects
- Inheritance
- Polymorphism
- Encapsulation
- Abstraction

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this section, you should be able to:
1. Understand the principles of object-oriented programming.
2. Create and use classes and objects in Python.
3. Implement inheritance and polymorphism in your code.
4. Apply encapsulation to protect data within your classes.

## How to Run the Programs
To run the programs in this section, follow these steps:
1. Ensure you have Python installed on your machine.
2. Navigate to the directory containing the code files.
3. Use the command line to execute a program, for example:
   ```bash
   python class_example.py
   ```
4. Follow any additional instructions provided in the individual code files for specific usage.
