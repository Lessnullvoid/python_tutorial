This section covers module creation, importing, and package organization.

## Directory Structure 
{{ Add a brief description of the directory structure here }}

## Codes and Descriptions
- **module_name.py**: A simple module demonstrating basic functions.
- **import_examples.py**: A script showcasing different import methods.
- **package_structure/**: A directory containing files organized as a package.
- **third_party_example.py**: A script that uses a third-party package.
- **my_package/**: A directory containing the user-created package.

## Learning Objectives
- Understand how to create and use Python modules.
- Learn different methods of importing modules.
- Organize Python files into packages effectively.
- Utilize third-party packages using `pip`.
- Create and test your own Python package.

## How to Run the Programs
1. Ensure you have Python installed on your machine.
2. Navigate to the directory containing the scripts.
3. Use the command `python module_name.py` to run the simple module.
4. For import examples, run `python import_examples.py`.
5. Follow the instructions in the `package_structure` directory to test the package.
6. Install any third-party packages using `pip install package_name` before running `third_party_example.py`.
7. To test your own package, follow the instructions provided in the `my_package` directory.
