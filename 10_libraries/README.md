# Python Libraries and Frameworks (Section 10)

This section covers popular Python libraries for data science, web requests, and databases.

## List and Description of Codes
- **Pandas**: A library for data manipulation and analysis, providing data structures like DataFrames.
- **NumPy**: A library for numerical computing, offering support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices.
- **Requests**: A simple HTTP library for making web requests.
- **SQLAlchemy**: A SQL toolkit and Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) system for Python.
