# Basic Python Syntax (Section 02)

This section covers fundamental Python syntax and basic programming concepts.

## Directory Structure 

## Codes Overview

- **variables.py**: Demonstrates variable declaration, assignment, and usage in Python.
- **operators.py**: Illustrates arithmetic, comparison, and logical operators with examples.
- **comments.py**: Shows how to write single-line and multi-line comments in Python.
- **input_output.py**: Provides examples of using `input()` for user input and `print()` for output.

## Content of This Section

This section includes exercises that help you understand the basic syntax of Python, including how to declare variables, use operators, write comments, and handle input/output operations.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this section, you should be able to:
1. Declare and use variables in Python.
2. Understand and apply different types of operators.
3. Write effective comments in your code.
4. Handle user input and output in Python programs.

## How to Run the Programs

To run the programs in this section, follow these steps:
1. Ensure you have Python installed on your machine.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt.
3. Navigate to the directory containing the Python files.
4. Run a program using the command: `python filename.py`, replacing `filename.py` with the name of the file you want to execute (e.g., `python variables.py`).
