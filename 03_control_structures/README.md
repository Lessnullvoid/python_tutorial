# Control Structures in Python (Section 03)

This section covers Python's control flow mechanisms including conditionals and loops.

## Directory Structure 

## File Descriptions

### loops.py
This file contains examples of different types of loops in Python, including `for` loops and `while` loops. It demonstrates how to iterate over sequences and perform repeated actions.

### loop_control.py
In this file, you will find control statements that alter the flow of loops, such as `break`, `continue`, and `pass`. It provides examples of how to use these statements effectively within loop constructs.

### conditionals.py
This file showcases the use of conditional statements in Python, including `if`, `elif`, and `else`. It illustrates how to make decisions in code based on various conditions.

## List and Description of Codes
- **loops.py**: Demonstrates various loop constructs in Python.
- **loop_control.py**: Shows how to control loop execution with statements like `break` and `continue`.
- **conditionals.py**: Illustrates decision-making in Python using conditional statements.

## Content of This Section
This section provides practical examples and explanations of control structures in Python, focusing on how to manage the flow of execution in your programs through loops and conditionals.

## Learning Objectives
- Understand the different types of loops in Python and when to use them.
- Learn how to control loop execution with statements like `break`, `continue`, and `pass`.
- Gain proficiency in using conditional statements to make decisions in code.

## How to Run the Programs
1. Ensure you have Python installed on your machine.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt.
3. Navigate to the directory containing the files.
4. Run the desired program using the command:
   ```bash
   python <filename>.py
   ```
   Replace `<filename>` with `loops`, `loop_control`, or `conditionals` as needed.
