# Python Data Structures (Section 04)

This section covers Python's built-in data structures and their operations.

## Directory Structure 

## Codes Overview
- **list_operations.py**: Demonstrates various list operations including creation, indexing, and slicing.
- **tuple_example.py**: Shows how to create and manipulate tuples, highlighting their immutability.
- **dictionary_methods.py**: Provides examples of dictionary methods such as `get()`, `keys()`, and `values()`.
- **set_operations.py**: Illustrates set operations including union, intersection, and difference.
- **comprehensions.py**: Contains examples of list and dictionary comprehensions for efficient data manipulation.

## Exercises Overview
- **Exercise 1: Lists**  
  This exercise covers the creation, manipulation, and common methods associated with Python lists.

- **Exercise 2: Tuples**  
  This exercise focuses on the immutability of tuples and how to use them effectively in Python.

- **Exercise 3: Dictionaries**  
  This exercise explores key-value pairs, dictionary methods, and practical use cases for dictionaries.

- **Exercise 4: Sets**  
  This exercise introduces sets, their properties, and operations such as union, intersection, and difference.

- **Exercise 5: Comprehensions**  
  This exercise demonstrates list and dictionary comprehensions for concise and efficient data manipulation. 

## Content of This Section
This section includes practical exercises and examples that illustrate the use of Python's built-in data structures. Each exercise is designed to reinforce the concepts and provide hands-on experience.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this section, you should be able to:
1. Understand and utilize Python's built-in data structures effectively.
2. Perform operations on lists, tuples, dictionaries, and sets.
3. Implement list and dictionary comprehensions for data manipulation.
4. Apply these data structures in practical programming scenarios.

## How to Run the Programs
To run the programs in this section, follow these steps:
1. Ensure you have Python installed on your machine.
2. Navigate to the `04_data_structures` directory in your terminal.
3. Use the command `python <filename>.py` to execute the desired program, replacing `<filename>` with the name of the specific file you want to run (e.g., `python list_operations.py`).
